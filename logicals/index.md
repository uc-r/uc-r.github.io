As well as numeric and character vectors, R allows manipulation of logical quantities. The elements of a logical vector can have the values `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NA` (for “not available”). The first two are often abbreviated as `T` and `F`, respectively. Note however that `T` and `F` are just variables which are set to `TRUE` and `FALSE` by default, but are not reserved words and hence can be overwritten by the user. Hence, you should always use `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

Logical vectors are generated by conditions. For example:


```r
x <- 5

x > 13
## [1] FALSE
```

The result is a logical output the same length as `x` with values `FALSE` corresponding to elements of `x` where the condition is not met and `TRUE` where it is.  Thus, a vector of several elements being compared to a value will result in a logical vector with length equal to x.


```r
x <- c(5, 14, 10, 22)

x > 13
## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```


The logical operators are `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==` for exact equality and `!=` for inequality.  We can also use `%in%` for group membership and `is.na` for missing values. 


```r
12 == 12
## [1] TRUE

12 <= c(12, 11)
## [1]  TRUE FALSE

12 %in% c(12, 11, 8)
## [1] TRUE

x <- c(12, NA, 11, NA, 8)
is.na(x)
## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
```


Logical vectors may be used in ordinary arithmetic, in which case they are coerced into
numeric vectors, `FALSE` becoming 0 and `TRUE` becoming 1. 


```r
x <- c(5, 14, 10, 22)

# how many elements in x are greater than 13?
sum(x > 13)
## [1] 2
```
