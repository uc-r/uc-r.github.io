Welcome to week 1! Although we will not meet in class until the end of this week (Monday, October 21<sup>th</sup>), I do not want to waste time in getting started. We only have 7 weeks together (&#x1f622;) so I want to pack each week as full as possible. I am assuming you have fully read the syllabus ([electronic](http://uc-r.github.io/data_wrangling) or [hardcopy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8icyjucwdcs76b0/Data%20Wrangling%20with%20R%20Syllabus%20%282019%20Fall%29.pdf?dl=1)) by now but if not please do so that you understand how this class is structured and what is expected of you.  I will spend the first few minutes of class on Monday re-iterating a few points so that we are all on the same page but I do not want to spend 30-60 minutes doing so, so make sure you read (and re-read) it thoroughly.

The focus of this week is two-fold:

1. To get yourself (re-)introduced to R and the RStudio IDE.
2. To introduce you to base R data selection/manipulation/cleaning techniques. 

Below outlines the reading and homework that you complete before next week's class. The skills and functions introduced in these readings will be necessary for Monday's in-class activities. If you have any questions or concerns your first step should be going to our [slack channel](https://uc-data-wrangling.slack.com) and posting your issue.  You and your classmates should be monitoring slack to help each other out. In addition, I will also be watching slack and will chime in when necessary but my hope is that this will be a social process where everyone contributes to knowledge advancement.
