Logistic regression is a foundational analytic technique for classification problems.  It allows us to estimate the probability of a categorical response based on one or more predictor variables and tells us if the presence of a predictor increases (or decreases) the probability of a given outcome by a specific percentage. Check out the recently added [tutorial on logistic regression](http://uc-r.github.io/logistic_regression).
