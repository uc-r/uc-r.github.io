Artificial neural networks (ANNs) describe a specific class of machine learning algorithms designed to acquire their own knowledge by extracting useful patterns from data. ANNs are function approximators, mapping inputs to outputs, and are composed of many interconnected computational units, called neurons. Each individual neuron possesses little intrinsic approximation capability; however, when many neurons function cohesively together, their combined effects show remarkable learning performance. A new set of [tutorials](http://uc-r.github.io/predictive#deep-learning) introduce you to this popular analytic technique.
