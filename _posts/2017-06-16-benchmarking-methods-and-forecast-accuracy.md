In this new [time series tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/ts_benchmarking), you will learn general tools that are useful for many different forecasting situations. It will describe some methods for benchmark forecasting, methods for checking whether a forecasting model has adequately utilized the available information, and methods for measuring forecast accuracy. These are important tools to have in your forecasting toolbox as each are leveraged repeatedly as you develop and explore a range of forecasting methods.
