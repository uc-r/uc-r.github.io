title: New Tutorials for Better Workflow
---

A.A. Milne said that *"organization is what you do before you do something, so that when you do it, it is not all mixed up."* If you are not careful your data analyses can become an explosion of data files, R scripts, ggplot graphs, and final reports. Each project evolves and mutates in its own way and keeping all the files associated with a project organized together is a wise practice. Furthermore, reproducibility is crucial in any analytic project. 

RStudio provides several great options for improving your analytic workflow.  This includes RStudio projects, R Markdown, and the newly released R Notebook.  Check out the tutorials we just released on these tools and get your analytic workflow moving in the right direction before your next project!
